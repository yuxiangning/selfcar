# selfcar
a raspberry pi powered self driving toy car

Goal
======

Just to have some fun with a toy race car, and AI/machine learning.

Hardware
========

- A very old race car body from my friend. It still has a DC motor (now broken and I'm ordering a new one), and a servo for steering
- Raspberry PI 3
- Camera for raspberry
- 10 A H-bridge for controlling DC motor
- 3S lipo battery
- Bread board and wire

Software
========

My plan is to start recording some data with this car, then we could use any machine learning library to handle the data.

Status
======

- 2017/12/14 DC morot is doomed, most likely it's too old. Ordered a new one, and a bunch of gears.
- 2017/12/15 Working on the software part, looks like the recording is OK.
